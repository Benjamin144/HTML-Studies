    <h1>Structured Programming</h1>

    <p>Structured programming is a programming paradigm aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of
        a computer program by making extensive use of the structured control flow constructs of selection (if/then/else)
        and repetition (while and for), block structures, and subroutines.</p>
    <p>Looping prevents the need to write out instructions, again and again.
        That is, we write the code once then repeatedly use or execute that code until the condition is false. The code
        is reused for each iteration.</p>
    <p>Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based on their features. ... Some paradigms are
        concerned mainly with implications for the execution model of the language, such as allowing side effects, or
        whether the sequence of operations is defined by the execution model.</p>

    <h1>Procedural Programming</h1>

    <p>Procedural programming is a programming **paradigm**, derived from **imperative** programming, based on the
        concept of the **procedure calls. Procedures simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out.
    </p>

    <p>The Procedural paradigm took the concept of code reuse even further.
        Procedural languages allow us to take lines of code and group them together in order to carry out a task. We can
        give names to these groups.
        These named groups are called procedures or subroutines or functions.
        When we want to use a function in a program we can simply refer to that function name in our code. When the
        program is run, the execution will divert into the function. The function will then do what it needs to do in
        order to assist the overall program. Once the function has completed its task execution resumes along the main
        program path. A function can be referred to (called) in a program more than once.
    </p>
    <P>In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a
        program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an
        imperative program consists of commands* for the computer to perform.</P>

    <h1>Object Orientated Programming</h1>

    <p>Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects",
        which can contain **data and code:** data in the form of **fields**, and code, in the form of **procedures**.
        A feature of objects is that an object's **own procedures** can access and often modify the data fields of
        itself.

        Object-oriented programming is often the most natural and **pragmatic** approach, once you get the hang of it.
        OOP languages allow you to break down your software into bite-sized problems that you then can solve â€” one
        object at a time.
        This isn't to say that OOP is the One True Way.
    </p>

    <p>Object-oriented programming is an extension of procedural programming.
        The focus of Object-oriented programming is on grouping functions and data into what are called "classes".
        Classes represent the properties and behaviors of groups of related things. Things such as customers, cats,
        sneakers and bicycles.
        For example, the properties or data that all restaurant customers share might be
        "first name", "last name", "email", "booking date", "booking time" "number of persons" "last booking" and "total
        number of bookings".
        The behaviors or functions that all customers share might be "make a booking", "cancel a booking", "receive a
        reward".

        Classes are used as blueprints for creating objects.
        Classes are written in code.</p>

    <h1>Event Programming</h1>

    <p>In computer programming, event-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is
        determined by events such as user actions, sensor outputs, or message passing from other programs or threads


    </p>Event-driven programming is another extension of the procedural paradigm
    Event-driven programming involves code running in the background waiting for something to happen. Once that
    something happens like the movement of a mouse the click of a button or keyboard entry takes place, code that is
    specifically waiting, or listening, for such events kicks into action and responds based on the task it was written
    to perform.</p>
