    <h1>Header</h1>
    <p>
        In information technology,
        Header, refers to supplemental data placed at the beginning of a block of data
        being stored or transmitted. In data transmission, the data following the header is sometimes called the payload
        or body. Its also provides introductory content. Beginning top of page h1 to h6. Like the example below.
    </p>
    <h1>h1</h1>
    <h2>h2</h2>
    <h3>h3</h3>
    <h4>h4</h4>
    <h5>h5</h5>
    <h6>h6</h6>

    <h1>Nav</h1>
    <p>
        The Navigation Section element The HTML
        Nav element represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigation links, either within the
        current document or to other documents. Common examples of navigation sections are menus, tables of contents,
        and
        indexes. As you imagine might imagine the nav element represents a location on a page
        that links to other pages or parts within a page. It's like a section with navigation links. Note though,
        that not all groups of links on a page need to be in a nav element, only sections that consist of major
        navigation blocks are appropriate for the nav element. There are many others</p>
    <h1>Section</h1>
    <p>
        The HTML section element represents a generic standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more
        specific semantic element to represent it.
        Sections should always have a heading, with very few exceptions.
        The section element, is used to represent a group of related
        content. This is similar to the purpose of an article element but the main
        difference being the content, within a section element, it doesn't necessarily
        need to make sense outside of the context of the page. A websites home page
        could be split into sections, for introduction, news items, and contact
        information. Sections could also define a newspaper section summaries links to
        sports, current affairs, lifestyle, politics, and arts reviews.
    </p>
    <h1>Aside</h1>
    <p>
        The aside element represents a section of a page that consists of content that is tangentially related to the
        content around the aside element, and which could be considered separate from that content. Such sections are
        often represented as sidebars in printed typography.
        Now when used within an article element the contents
        of an aside should be specifically related to the article, for example, a glossary.
        But when an aside is used outside of an article element
        the contents should be related to the entire site, maybe a
        Twitter feed, groups of additional navigation, and even advertising, if the
        content is related to that page.
    </p>
    <h1>Article</h1>
    <p>
        HTML5 article is an HTML5 semantic element, similar to section or header, and an introductory peice of content.
        It is most commonly used to contain information that may be distributed independently from the rest of
        the site or application it appears in. This could be a blog post a magazine or newspaper article, user submitted comment, 
        an interactive widget, or any other independent item of content.
    </p>
    <h1>Footer</h1>
    <p>
        The footer tag is used within the body tag. The footer tag is new in the HTML5. 
        The footer elements require a start tag as well as an end tag. A footer element typically contains authorship information, 
        copyright information, contact information, sitemap, back to top links, related documents,
        The footer element works very much in the same way as the header element, but in addition to navigation elements, a footer
        typically contains information about its section as to who wrote it, links to related documents, copyright data, and alike.
    </p>
    <h1>Semantic Definition</h1>
    <p>
        Semantic meaning relating to meaning in language or logic</p>
