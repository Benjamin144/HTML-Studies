<!-- The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an XML 
    or HTML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document. 
    The DOM represents a document with a logical tree-->

<!-- A "node", in this context, is simply an HTML element. The "DOM" is a tree structure that represents the HTML of the website, and every HTML element is a "node". 
    See Document Object Model (DOM). More specifically, "Node" is an interface that is implemented by multiple other objects, including "document" and "element".-->

<!-- XML - Extensible Markup Language is a markup language and file format for storing, transmitting, and reconstructing arbitrary data. 
         - (Arbitary meaning - based on random choice or personal whim, rather than any reason or system.)
    It defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.-->

<!-- Encoding is the process of converting data into a format required for a number of information processing needs, 
    including: Program compiling and execution. Data transmission, storage and compression/decompression. Application data processing, such as file conversion.-->

<!-- languages like CSS JavaScript can access and manipulate these objects to create something dynamic and interactive-->
