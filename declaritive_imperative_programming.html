    <h1>Structured Programming</h1>
    <p>Structured programming is a programming paradigm aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of
        a computer program by making extensive use of the structured control flow constructs of selection (if/then/else)
        and repetition (while and for)**, block structures, and subroutines.</p>
    <p>Looping prevents the need to write out instructions, again and again.
        That is, we write the code once then repeatedly use or execute that code until the condition is false. The code
        is reused for each iteration.</p>
    <p>Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based on their features. ... Some paradigms are
        concerned mainly with implications for the execution model of the language, such as allowing side effects, or
        whether the sequence of operations is defined by the execution model.</p>
