<!-- Declarative programming is a method to abstract away the control flow for logic required for software to perform an action, 
    and instead involves stating what the task or desired outcome is.
    When code is written declaritivley, it describes what you want to do, and not how you want to do it. 
    It is left up to the compiler to figure out the how logically-->

<!-- Simple put, a mutable object can be **changed** after it is created, and an immutable object can't. 
    Objects of built-in types like (int, float, bool, str, tuple, unicode) are immutable. 
    Objects of built-in types like (list, set, dict) are mutabled
    A mutatable object is an object whose state can be modified after it is created. 
    An immutable object is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created. 
    Examples of native JavaScript values that are immutable are numbers and strings.-->

<!-- Imperative programming is a software development paradigm where functions are implicitly coded in every step required to solve a problem. 
    In imperative programming, every operation is coded and the code itself specifies how the problem is to be solved, 
    which means that pre-coded models are not called on. -->

<!-- As with declarative programming the instructions are represented as lines of code. The lines of code are executed one at a time from top to bottom 
    but the difference with imperative programming is the ability to apply logic and decision-making within these instructions. 
    In imperative programming this sequence of instructions is referred to as an algorithm. -->

<!-- Structured programming offers the ability to loop through specially delineated lines of code. -->
<!-- Delineated is defined as something described exactly or accurately. When the rules of your club dictated an exact, precise code of behavior, 
    this is an example of when they delineated the correct behavior.-->

<!-- To summerise, An algorithm is a  process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.
    An algorithm is a set of instructions designed to perform a specific task. This can be a simple process, such as multiplying two numbers, 
    or a complex operation, such as playing a compressed video file. Therefore, programmers usually seek to create the most efficient algorithms possible. 
    An algorithm is a set of step-by-step procedures, or a set of rules to follow, for completing a specific task or solving a particular problem. ... 
    The recipe for baking a cake, the method we use to solve a long division problem, and the process of doing laundry are all examples of an algorithm-->
